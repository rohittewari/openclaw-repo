# Data Ingestion Diagram Notes

- File: `data-ingestion-pipeline-aws.drawio`
- This version uses **AWS icon images** (SVG URLs from `awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml`) so visuals are real AWS service icons in diagrams.net.
- If any icon does not render in your environment, open draw.io and replace that node via:
  - **More Shapes → AWS Architecture**
  - drag/drop the official icon onto the existing node
- Keep layout + connectors unchanged to preserve architecture flow.
